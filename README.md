# Backtest IMC Prosperity 2023

This is repo contains utilities for IMC Prosperity 2023 challenge.
Right now, it has the [backtester.py](./backtester.py), that should mimic log files from
the prosperity challenge [platform](https://prosperity.imc.com/).
The profit calculation doesn't work yet.


Though the format is good enough
to be accepted by jmerle's amazing [project](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-visualizer),
for visualizing the order book as well as your trades.
Check out [dontlooseshells.py](./backtester.py) on how to update your logger class to work with this repo.

Good luck üçÄ
